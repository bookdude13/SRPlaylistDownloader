# Synth Riderz Playlist Downloader
Automatically download all custom songs from Synth Riderz playlists when starting the game.


## Installing
1. Prepare Synth Riders for modding by following the [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README) wiki guide
2. Download the newest version of SRPerformanceMeter from the Releases section. Your web browser may warn you about the .zip file because it contains a .dll - this is normal, and is how mods are built.
3. Extract the contents of the .zip file to  `<path-to-synth-riders>\Mods` (create a new directory if it doesn't exist). On Windows, this will be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SynthRiders\Mods`
4. Run Synth Riders and enjoy!
